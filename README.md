---

## 🔐 Password-Protected Configuration

The system uses a password to protect examination configuration settings.

When the configuration interrupt is triggered:

1. The user is asked to enter the password.
2. The entered password is compared with the stored password.
3. The user gets limited password attempts.
4. After successful authentication, the user can access the configuration menu.

The configuration menu provides options for:

* RTC time
* RTC date
* Examination start time
* Examination duration
* Password modification

---

## ⏰ Examination Time Management

The administrator can configure:

* Examination start hour
* Examination start minute
* Examination duration

The system continuously compares the configured examination start time with the RTC.

Once the configured start time is reached, the examination session begins automatically.

---

## ⏱️ Remaining Time Display

The remaining examination time is displayed using a **two-digit multiplexed 7-segment display**.

The system calculates the remaining examination time as:

```text
Remaining Time = Exam Duration - Effective Elapsed Time
```

The system also accounts for the paused duration so that the examination countdown does not decrease while the examination is paused.

---

## ⏸️ Pause / Resume Function

An external interrupt is used to pause and resume the examination.

When the pause interrupt occurs:

* The current examination time is recorded.
* The examination countdown is paused.
* The pause count is incremented.

When the interrupt occurs again:

* The examination resumes.
* The paused duration is excluded from the examination countdown.

The LCD displays the pause count and current pause status.

---

## 🌡️ Temperature Monitoring

An LM35 temperature sensor is connected to the LPC2148 ADC.

The temperature measurement process is:

```text
LM35 Temperature Sensor
          ↓
    Analog Voltage
          ↓
      LPC2148 ADC
          ↓
     ADC Conversion
          ↓
 Temperature Calculation
          ↓
      LCD Display
```

The temperature is calculated and displayed in degrees Celsius.

---

## 🚦 LED Warning System

The system provides visual warnings based on the remaining examination time.

| Remaining Time       | Indicator |
| -------------------- | --------- |
| More than 15 minutes | Normal    |
| 15 minutes or less   | LED3      |
| 10 minutes or less   | LED2      |
| 5 minutes or less    | LED1      |
| 0 minutes            | Buzzer    |

The LED warning level changes automatically as the examination approaches completion.

---

## 🔔 Examination Completion

When the remaining examination time reaches zero:

```text
Remaining Time = 0
        ↓
    Exam Ends
        ↓
      Buzzer
```

The buzzer provides an audio indication that the examination session has finished.

## ⚠️ Challenges Faced and Solutions

### 1. Multiplexed 7-Segment Display

**Challenge:**
Displaying the remaining examination time using a two-digit multiplexed 7-segment display requires continuous refreshing of both digits.

**Solution:**
Implemented multiplexing logic with appropriate timing and digit selection to provide a stable display.

### 2. Pause / Resume Timing

**Challenge:**
The examination countdown should not decrease while the examination is paused.

**Solution:**
The pause time is recorded and excluded from the effective elapsed examination time.

### 3. Temperature Measurement

**Challenge:**
The LM35 provides an analog voltage that must be converted into a meaningful temperature value.

**Solution:**
The ADC is used to convert the analog signal into a digital value, which is then processed to calculate the temperature.

### 4. External Interrupt Handling

**Challenge:**
Configuration and pause/resume operations must respond to external events without affecting normal system operation.

**Solution:**
External interrupts and the VIC interrupt controller are used to handle event-driven operations.

### 5. Multiple Peripheral Integration

**Challenge:**
Several peripherals must operate together while maintaining correct timing and system behavior.

**Solution:**
Each module was developed and tested individually before integrating the modules into the final application.
